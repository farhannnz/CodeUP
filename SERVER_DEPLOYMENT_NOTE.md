# 📝 Server Deployment Note

## ⚠️ Important: Progress Tracking Endpoints

The progress tracking and certificate features require **new backend endpoints** that need to be deployed to your server.

---

## 🔧 What Needs to be Deployed

### **New Endpoints Added to `server/index.js`:**

1. `POST /complete-lecture` - Mark lecture as completed
2. `GET /course-progress/:courseId` - Get course progress
3. `GET /generate-certificate/:courseId` - Generate certificate

These endpoints are in your **local** `server/index.js` file but need to be deployed to:
```
https://codeup-ql59.onrender.com/
```

---

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### **Option 1: Render.com (If using Render)**

1. **Push to Git:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add progress tracking and certificate endpoints"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Render Auto-Deploys:**
   - Render will automatically detect changes
   - Wait for deployment to complete
   - Check deployment logs

### **Option 2: Manual Deployment**

1. **Copy server/index.js** to your deployment
2. **Restart the server**
3. **Verify endpoints work**

---

## ✅ Current Status

### **Frontend:**
- ✅ All code updated
- ✅ Handles missing endpoints gracefully
- ✅ Shows fallback messages
- ✅ Won't crash if endpoints don't exist

### **Backend:**
- ⚠️ New endpoints in local code
- ⚠️ Need to be deployed
- ⚠️ Currently returning 404

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

### **Test Progress Tracking:**
```bash
# Test complete-lecture endpoint
curl -X POST https://codeup-ql59.onrender.com/complete-lecture \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"lectureId":"LECTURE_ID","courseId":"COURSE_ID"}'

# Should return: { success: true, progress: 25, ... }
```

### **Test Progress Fetching:**
```bash
# Test course-progress endpoint
curl https://codeup-ql59.onrender.com/course-progress/COURSE_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Should return: { success: true, progress: 50, ... }
```

### **Test Certificate:**
```bash
# Test generate-certificate endpoint
curl https://codeup-ql59.onrender.com/generate-certificate/COURSE_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Should return: { success: true, certificate: {...} }
```

## 📊 What Works Now (Without Deployment)

### ✅ **Working Features:**
- User authentication
- Course browsing
- Course enrollment
- Lecture watching
- Profile management
- My Learning page
- All existing features

### ⏳ **Pending Deployment:**
- Progress tracking
- Mark lecture as complete
- Certificate generation
- Certificate download

---

## 💡 Temporary Behavior

Until endpoints are deployed:

### **Mark as Complete Button:**
- Shows: "Lecture marked as complete! (Progress tracking coming soon)"
- Doesn't crash
- User can still watch lectures

### **Progress Bar:**
- Shows: 0%
- Doesn't update
- Doesn't break the page

### **Certificate Button:**
- Won't appear (needs 100% progress)
- Will work after deployment

---

## 🎯 Quick Deploy Checklist

- [ ] Commit server/index.js changes
- [ ] Push to Git repository
- [ ] Wait for Render deployment
- [ ] Check deployment logs
- [ ] Test /complete-lecture endpoint
- [ ] Test /course-progress endpoint
- [ ] Test /generate-certificate endpoint
- [ ] Verify progress tracking works
- [ ] Verify certificate generation works

## 📞 If You Need Help Deploying

### **Check Current Deployment:**
```bash
# Test if server is running
curl https://codeup-ql59.onrender.com/courses

# Should return list of courses
```

### **Check Render Dashboard:**
1. Go to render.com
2. Find your backend service
3. Check "Events" tab for deployment status
4. Check "Logs" tab for errors

---

## ✅ After Deployment

Once deployed, all features will work:
- ✅ Progress tracking
- ✅ Visual progress bar
- ✅ Mark lectures as complete
- ✅ Certificate generation
- ✅ PDF download

---

**Status**: Frontend ready, backend needs deployment
**Priority**: Medium (features work without it, but enhanced with it)
**Time**: 5-10 minutes to deploy

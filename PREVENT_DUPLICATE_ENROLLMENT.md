# ✅ Prevent Duplicate Enrollment - Fixed

## 🎯 Feature Added

Users can no longer enroll in a course they're already enrolled in!

---

## 🔧 What Was Changed

### File Modified:
`client/src/components/ui/ViewCourse.jsx`

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Check Enrollment Status on Page Load
```javascript
// When course page loads, check if user is already enrolled
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchCourse = async () => {
    // Fetch course details
    const courseData = response.data.course;
    
    // Check user's enrolled courses
    if (token) {
      const profileResponse = await axios.get("/profile");
      const enrolledCourseIds = profileResponse.data.enrolledCourses;
      const isEnrolled = enrolledCourseIds.includes(id);
      
      // Set enrolled status
      setCourse({ ...courseData, enrolled: isEnrolled });
    }
  };
}, [id]);
```

#### 2. Prevent Duplicate Enrollment
```javascript
const handlePurchase = async () => {
  // Check if already enrolled
  if (course.enrolled) {
    alert("You are already enrolled in this course!");
    return;  // Stop here
  }
  
  // Proceed with enrollment...
};
```

#### 3. Handle Server-Side Duplicate Check
```javascript
// If server returns "Already enrolled" error
if (errorMessage.includes("Already enrolled")) {
  setCourse({ ...course, enrolled: true });  // Update UI
}
```

---

## ✨ Features

### 1. Visual Indication
- **Not Enrolled**: Button shows "Enroll Now" (blue/purple gradient)
- **Already Enrolled**: Button shows "Enrolled" (gray, disabled)

### 2. Button States
```javascript
// Button is disabled when enrolled
<button 
  disabled={course.enrolled}
  className={course.enrolled ? "enrolled" : ""}
>
  {course.enrolled ? "Enrolled" : "Enroll Now"}
</button>
```

### 3. Multiple Protection Layers

**Layer 1: Frontend Check (Immediate)**
```javascript
if (course.enrolled) {
  alert("You are already enrolled!");
  return;
}
```

**Layer 2: Server Check (Backup)**
```javascript
// Server also checks and returns error
if (course.enrolledStudents.includes(userId)) {
  return res.status(400).json({ 
    message: "Already enrolled in this course" 
  });
}
```

**Layer 3: UI Update**
```javascript
// If somehow user tries again, UI updates
setCourse({ ...course, enrolled: true });
```

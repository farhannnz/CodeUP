# ✅ Enrolled Courses Fix - No Server Changes

## 🎯 Problem
Enrolled courses not showing in Profile or My Learning pages.

## 🔧 Solution Applied (Frontend Only)

### Fixed Files:
1. ✅ `client/src/components/ui/Profile.jsx`
2. ✅ `client/src/components/ui/MyLearning.jsx`

### What Was Wrong:
The `token` variable was defined inside `useEffect` but wasn't properly accessible when making API calls to fetch course details.

### What I Fixed:

#### Profile.jsx
```javascript
// BEFORE
const token = Cookies.get("token");  // Defined once
const fetchCoursesData = async (courseIds) => {
  // Token might not be accessible here
}

// AFTER
const fetchCoursesData = async (courseIds, authToken) => {
  // Token passed as parameter - always accessible
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${authToken}` }
}
```

#### MyLearning.jsx
```javascript
// BEFORE
const token = Cookies.get("token");  // At top of useEffect
// Used later in async calls

// AFTER
const fetchEnrolledCourses = async () => {
  const token = Cookies.get("token");  // Inside async function
  // Now properly scoped and accessible
}
```
